                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the Chess Health Theater-V Manager App.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theater-V is a five room theater showing selected classic movies based on USA Today ratings 
                    and a few of Andy's personal favorites thrown in. You will use this Manager App
                    to track ticket sales in real time throughout the day. Ticket sales for any screening may
                    not exceed the capacity of the room in which the movie is being shown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use the <b>Admin Console</b> to assign movies and seating capacities for the screening rooms.
                    All Screening Rooms default to 100 seats but may be changed. 
                    Once the settings are finalized they are used for the entire day at the theater.
                    You may also simulate a day of sales using the Simulate Day button and view the report.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use the <b>Order Tickets</b> panel to order tickets for movies at certain show times. 
                    Rather than repeatedly prompting for ticket sales as in a console-based app, this screen 
                    will be used to fill user orders on demand and will enforce valid input and maximum seating capacities.
                    Use the Simulate Order button to quickly and easily add new ticket orders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use the <b>Sales Reports</b> panel to view the ticket sales at any time during the day.
                    This displays the entire state of the Theater-V based on current settings and sales.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those software-types out there, this is a "micro-MVC" app which uses an HTML/CSS front end
                    to update a JavaScript object model (screening rooms, times, movies) representing the 
                    Theater-V state under the hood. The entire app and UI clocks in at under 25K minimized.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    <h2>Good luck and sell those tickets!</h2>

                    Please assign Movies and seating capacities for the various theater Screening Rooms.
                    Only one movie may be assigned to any Screening Room (no simultaneous screenings) for the day.

                    Once the <b>Accept Settings</b> button is clicked they cannot be 
                    changed for today unless you refresh the app.
